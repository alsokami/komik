## Komik

Komik: The all around technology mod which improves vanilla minecraft like non-other. From eco-friendly energy to complex machinery, komik has it all! Currently, Komik is in massive work in progress open-Alpha right now. So it only has a few features. But give it time, and you will see, that it will revolutionise minecraft.

## What Komik Does

Komik as of right now only has a handful of features. The date of today, november 30, 2024, is the first and only day I put as of coding this minecraft mod. The main features it currently has right now is a **400W Solar Panel**, **custom ore generation**, **solar cells**, **oil refinery**, **oil buckets**, and **industrial ores such as silver, aluminum, and silicon**.
